# Artefact Security System

Thefts are increasing at an alarming rate all over the world. This system emphasizes the creation of a real time system to overcome the problems faced due to these types of robbery. This is a simple design to detect the theft and alarm the premises about the theft. We have used a simple active buzzer and a force sensor to detect the weight in the sensor and sense the buzzer for its state of action. By this, we can stop and notify the respective about the theft.

Museums display artifacts to the public in open displays. Our device acts as a burglar deterrent as it can sound off a buzzer to whenever an artifact has been moved from its place Artifacts can be placed on top of a force sensor and buzzer is activated whenever weight on the force sensor becomes zero. This can also be applied in households as secure open storage to place things on. If someone attempts to steal from the desk, it will trigger the sound to alarm that an object has been lifted.
